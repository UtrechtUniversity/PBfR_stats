  This repository contains the Quarto document that
  generates a usage report for the online module "Privacy
  Basics for Researchers". This module was developed by
  Research Data Management Support at Utrecht University as
  a self-paced e-learning module for researchers to learn
  about how to handle personal data in their research
  project. The report uses R to analyse who the participants
  are, their completion rates and their quiz results in the
  module.

# Privacy basics for resarchers - usage report
This repository contains the Quarto document that generates a usage report for the online module "Privacy Basics for Researchers". 
This module was developed in 2023 by Research Data Management Support at Utrecht University as part of the [Data Privacy Project](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyproject).
It is now offered as a standard self-paced e-learning module for researchers to learn about how to handle personal data in their research project.

The following aspects are considered in the usage report:

- Number and type of participants (UU, UU students or other)
- Activity completion of separate module components/chapters, because the fact that participants registered does not mean that they completed parts of the module
- Quiz results, to see how many participants made it until the end of the module

The report is based on data manually downloaded from the Ulearning environment (a Moodle-based learning environment). 
As the data upon which this report is based contain personal information (names and email addresses), they are not uploaded to GitHub.
